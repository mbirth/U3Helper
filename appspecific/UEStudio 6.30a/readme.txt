UEStudio_U3.u3p

This is a "light"-version for faster use from an U3-stick.

To have your needed "configs" and "projects"-data, do the following:

1. Install UEStudio locally to your PC.
2. Open UEStudio_U3H.u3p in Total Commander (Ctrl+PgDn, it's a ZIP-file)
   (You can use any other archive manager. You could even rename the file to .zip and use Explorer.)
3. In that archive find the "data" directory.
4. Now copy all needed "configs" or "projects" from your local UEStudio-installation over to that folder.
5. When done, install the new .u3p to your device.


To add aspell-dictionaries, find host/GNU/aspell/dict in step 3.
