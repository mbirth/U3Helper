How I came up with U3Helper
===========================

Well, I was a Windows user for years and thus knew the registry inside out. I
also knew that I could transfer any software from A to B if I only knew where it
stores all settings (i.e. where in the registry or on the disk).

I bought my first U3 stick when there were about 10 applications for it and
since I always carried a lot "stick" software with me, which didn't need any
configuration, I learned how to get these apps into the U3 format.

And then came some apps which I carried with me (in a non U3-way) and which
needed some set-up before you were able to run them on another computer. I
managed this by some batch scripts which imported registry settings and exported
them after use. Since I already knew a bit about how U3 works, I started
building U3Helper.

The first version started as *U3Assistant* and never came to life because I tried
to do some things (managing registry) the hard way and got stuck.

After some thinking I came up with the idea to use some of the Windows tools I
already used in my batch scripts. And thus *U3Helper* was born. I added more and
more features and now it can do the most things needed for portability. :-)

I always planned to re-write the whole thing in a more higher programming
language because the AutoHotkey code is very messy. But since I'm now running
Linux on all of my PCs, I don't think this will happen in the near future.

Also SanDisk announced a successor of the U3 principle which should be released
this year... so we'll see what happens...
